This little app currently capable of creating both midterm and final project repositories. It's deployed on render and all you need to do is to set the environment variables there. Set the env variable "midterm_project" to true if it's for midterm project and set it to false for final projects. Also set the repo_name_prefix variable based on the semester and year. Finally set the staff_team variable. results of team submissions are written into csv files in RESULTS_REPO_NAME.

list of env vars:

STAFF_TEAM_NAME: e.g. cs220-f25-staff
RESULTS_REPO_NAME: e.g. student_submitted_teams_results
REPO_NAME_PREFIX: e.g. 2026-spring 
MIDTERM_PROJECT: true or false
GITHUB_TOKEN: must have enough accesses
